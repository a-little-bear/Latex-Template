        \quad Recall that we have already explained in lecture that all rational function of a single variable can be integrated in finite terms. Starting from there, we introduce integrals of the form, known as the \textbf{binomial integrals}:
        \[\begin{aligned}J_{p,q}=\int(a+bz)^pz^q\D z,a,b\in\mathbb{R},p,q\in\mathbb{Q}. \end{aligned} \numberthis \label{eq1}\]
    
        This exercise aims at studying the rationalization of the binomial integral, as well as some of its applications.

            Since $q\in\Q$, this implies there exists $m\in\Z, n\in\N$ such that $q=\frac{m}{n}$. Then, $J_{p,q}$ can be written as \[\begin{aligned}J_{p,q}=\int(a+bz)^pz^{\frac{m}{n}}\D z.\end{aligned}\] Let $z=x^n$, then $\D z=n\cd x^{n-1}\D x$. Replace $z$ with $x$ we have \[\begin{aligned}J_{p,q}=\int(a+b\cd x^n)^p \cd (x^n)^{\frac{m}{n}}\cd n\cd x^{n-1}\D x.\end{aligned}\] Simplify it and we get \[\begin{aligned}J_{p,q}=n\int(a+b\cd x^n)^p \cd x^{m+n-1}\D x.\end{aligned}\] Now, by binomial theorem we can see the integrand is rationalised, as needed.
